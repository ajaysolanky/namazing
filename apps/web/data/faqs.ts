    q: "How does the AI naming process work?",
    a: "You share your family story, preferences, and any constraints. Our five-stage pipeline parses your brief, generates candidates, researches each name in depth (meanings, origins, popularity, cultural context), curates a shortlist of 8-12 finalists, and composes a personalized consultation report.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it really free?",
    a: "Yes! The free tier gives you full access to the consultation pipeline. We may offer premium features in the future, but the core experience is free.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kind of names can it suggest?",
    a: "Any style you like: classic, modern, literary, nature-inspired, heritage-based, and more. You tell us your preferences and cultural background, and the AI explores names across those style lanes.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a consultation take?",
    a: "A typical run completes in a few minutes. You can watch the pipeline work in real time as it researches each name candidate.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I run multiple consultations?",
    a: "Absolutely. Each run is saved to your dashboard so you can compare results, try different briefs, or refine your preferences.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data private?",
    a: "Your briefs and results are stored securely and only visible to you. We do not share your personal data with third parties.",
