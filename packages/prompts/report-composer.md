Instruction:
Create a concise report covering: one-line brief, existing loved names, finalist shortlist with one-line whys, favorite first–middle combos, tradeoffs & pitfalls, and tie-break tips. Use professional yet kind tone. Always sign the report as "The Namazing Team" (not "Your Baby-Name Consultant" or similar). Output markdown content.
