    "raw_brief": "We've been trying to come up with names for baby #2, and are not LOVING anything we've brainstormed so far, so we need all the help we can get! Here's what we're thinking so far: Our daughter's name is Lola, which we were dead set on from the beginning, which was lucky because the sex was a surprise and we had zero boy names lined up. This baby is also a surprise. We have a girl name ready to go for this second baby, but we are again struggling with boy names and boy middle names. So far we have Killian, Otto, Maddox, Merrick, Jameson, and Malcolm. I'm much more open to non-traditional names than my husband is, but I think I could probably sway him if it was the perfect fit. I'm also a teacher and would love something that's a little less common or recent. We would both love for the name to flow with our daughter's name. For the most part we're not nickname people, so we would prefer to have names that can stand alone or not be shortened unless the shortened version is something less traditional. For middle names, I think we're leaning towards names that we generally like and would go well with the first name. I think the only possible family name we would use as a middle name would be Thomas, however I'm not a huuuge fan. Names that my husband has vetoed include Silas, Micah, Jonah, Booker, Felix, Luca. I've vetoed Banks (because all I can think about is the Mighty Ducks) but honestly have forgotten most of the others he's recommended.",

    "summary": "**Dear [Parents\u2019 Names],**\n\n**Warm Opening**  \nFirst off, let me say how absolutely delightful Lola\u2019s name is\u2014short, bright, and instantly lyrical. It carries a vintage charm that feels both timeless and fresh, and it\u2019s a perfect anchor for a sibling who will share that same playful cadence. Your current list of favorites already hints at the kind of strong, distinctive vibe you\u2019re after, but I understand the search can feel like a maze when you\u2019re looking for that one name that clicks just right. I\u2019m here to help you navigate that maze with a few thoughtful tweaks and fresh options that keep Lola\u2019s rhythm in mind.\n\n---\n\n**Review of Your List**\n\n| First Name | What It Evokes | Popularity Context | Suggested Middle |\n|------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| **Killian** | A polished, almost aristocratic feel\u2014think \u201cthe gentleman in a tweed jacket.\u201d | Still relatively uncommon, but its Irish roots give it a classic gravitas. | **Killian Thomas** (if you\u2019re willing to give Thomas a second chance) or **Killian Elise** for a softer, literary touch. |\n| **Otto** | Old\u2011school, a nod to the early 20th\u2011century revival of Germanic names. It feels like a quiet, scholarly presence. | Rare in the U.S., but its vintage appeal is unmistakable. | **Otto Ren** or **Otto James**\u2014both keep the name intact while adding a gentle, modern middle. |\n| **Maddox** | A contemporary, almost \u201chipster\u201d vibe\u2014sharp, edgy, and unmistakably modern. | Rising in popularity; it\u2019s on the cusp of becoming mainstream. | **Maddox Elise** or **Maddox Finn**\u2014the latter keeps the adventurous spirit. |\n| **Merrick** | Strong, almost medieval\u2014think \u201cthe knight with a silver sword.\u201d | Still fairly unique, but its two\u2011syllable cadence pairs nicely with Lola. | **Merrick Thomas** (if you\u2019re open to it) or **Merrick Ren** for a subtle, literary flair. |\n| **Jameson** | A trendy, \u201ccraft\u201d name that feels like a modern whiskey\u2014smooth, sophisticated. | Currently climbing the popularity charts; it\u2019s becoming a go\u2011to for parents seeking something classic yet contemporary. | **Jameson Elise** or **Jameson Finn**\u2014both preserve the name\u2019s elegance while adding a fresh middle. |\n| **Malcolm** | Classic, a touch of Scottish heritage\u2014steady, dependable. | Still uncommon, but its familiarity might feel a bit too traditional for your \u201cless common\u201d goal. | **Malcolm Ren** or **Malcolm Finn**\u2014both give the name a modern lift. |\n\nA quick note on nicknames: all of these names can be shortened, but the common diminutives (Jack for Jameson, Mal for Malcolm, etc.) might feel too familiar or even too informal for your taste. If you prefer a name that stands alone without a nickname, the middle name can act as that \u201cextra syllable\u201d to give the full name its own identity.\n\n---\n\n**Fresh Ideas**\n\nBelow are eight names that weren\u2019t on your original list but share the same lyrical, two\u2011syllable cadence that pairs beautifully with Lola. I\u2019ve chosen them for their uniqueness, literary undertones, and the way they flow when spoken aloud.\n\n1. **Alder** \u2013 Nature\u2011inspired, short and sweet. *Alder Ren* or *Alder Elise* give it a gentle, literary feel.  \n2. **Orion** \u2013 Mythic, celestial. *Orion Finn* or *Orion James* keep the name grounded while adding a modern middle.  \n3. **Cassian** \u2013 Elegant, uncommon, with a literary flair. *Cassian Ren* or *Cassian Elise* sound like a storybook hero.  \n4. **Finnian** \u2013 Friendly, approachable, yet distinct. *Finnian Thomas* (if you\u2019re willing) or *Finnian Ren* keep the name unique.  \n5. **Eamon** \u2013 Refined, understated charm. *Eamon James* or *Eamon Elise* pair well with Lola\u2019s cadence.  \n6. **Zephyr** \u2013 Breezy, adventurous. *Zephyr Finn* or *Zephyr Ren* give it a modern twist.  \n7. **Leif** \u2013 Short, nature\u2011rooted, and easy to pronounce. *Leif Thomas* (if you\u2019re open) or *Leif Elise* keep the name fresh.  \n8. **Elio** \u2013 Modern, two\u2011syllable, and easy to pair. *Elio Finn* or *Elio Ren* feel both contemporary and timeless.\n\nEach of these names offers a distinct personality while maintaining the smooth, lyrical flow that makes Lola\u2019s name so charming. They\u2019re all less common, so you\u2019ll avoid the \u201ctoo trendy\u201d label, yet they\u2019re still recognizable enough to be easy for teachers and friends to pronounce\u2014something that will serve your little one well in school.\n\n---\n\n**Middle\u2011Name Pairings**\n\nYou mentioned a preference for middle names that \u201cgo well with the first name.\u201d Here are a few combinations that feel cohesive and avoid the nickname pitfalls:\n\n- **Alder Ren** \u2013 A literary, almost poetic pairing.  \n- **Orion Finn** \u2013 A modern, adventurous duo.  \n- **Cassian Elise** \u2013 A touch of old\u2011world elegance.  \n- **Finnian Thomas** \u2013 Classic, if you\u2019re willing to give Thomas a second chance.  \n- **Eamon James** \u2013 A subtle, refined combo.  \n- **Zephyr Ren** \u2013 Breezy, with a literary nod.  \n- **Leif Elise** \u2013 Short, sweet, and sophisticated.  \n- **Elio Finn** \u2013 Modern, approachable, and easy to say.\n\nIf Thomas still feels like a stretch, you might consider middle names like **Ren**, **Elise**, **Finn**, or **James**\u2014each brings a different flavor while keeping the overall name unique.\n\n---\n\n**Closing**\n\nChoosing a name is a deeply personal journey, and I\u2019m thrilled to have helped you explore both the familiar and the fresh. Whether you lean toward a name that feels like a quiet, scholarly presence or one that carries a mythic, adventurous spirit, the most important thing is that it feels right for your family. Remember, the name you choose will be the first story your child hears about themselves\u2014a story that will grow with them, just like Lola\u2019s name has already begun to do.\n\nI\u2019m excited to hear which of these resonates most with you. Feel free to reach out with any questions, or if you\u2019d like to brainstorm more options. Until then, congratulations on the upcoming arrival of your second little one\u2014may the name you choose bring as much joy and wonder to your home as Lola\u2019s has already.\n\nWarmest wishes,\n\n[Your Name]  \nBaby Name Consultant & Storyteller",
